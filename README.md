# PROJECT TITLE

 TEXT BASED EMOTION CLASSIFICATION BY NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION COMPARED WITH OTHER FOUR ALGORITHMS WHICH ARE RANDOM FOREST ALGORITHM, GUASSIAN NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM, DECISION TREE ALGORITHM AND K-NEAREST NEIGHBOR CLASSIFIER ALGORITHM.

AIM : It aims at designing the model for different processes like perception, sentiment, beliefs, and emotions. Sentiment analysis finds out the sentiment of the given text in terms of Fear, Sad, Joy and Anger.

INTRODUCTION:

Artificial Intelligence has contributed significantly to providing effective solutions to major human and societal problems under various fields including natural language processing (NLP), which employs computational and linguistics techniques to aid computers understand and sometimes generate human languages in the form of texts and speech/voice.1 Prominent contributions in the field of NLP under active research include translation systems, information retrieval (IR), questions and answering (Q & A) systems, text summarization systems, sentiment analysis (SA). Branching from the field of sentiment analysis whose core intent is to analyze human language by extracting opinions, ideas, and thoughts through the assignment of polarities either negative, positive, or neutral is the subfield of emotion detection (ED), which seeks to extract finer-grained emotions such as fear, sad, angry, and so on, from human languages.

Preparing the dataset:

There were a two columns named as text and label with 3614 rows. The label column has 4 unique values, they were ‘joy, fear, anger, and sad’.

LIST OF MODULES:

	Data Pre-processing

	Implementing Logistic Regression Algorithm 

	Implementing Random Forest Classifier Algorithm

	Implementing Gaussian Naïve Bayes Algorithm 

	Implementing Decision Tree Classifier Algorithm

	Implementing K- Nearest Neighbor’s Algorithm

	Deployment.

 Conclusion
 
 The analytical process started from data cleaning and processing, missing value, exploratory analysis and finally model building and evaluation. The best accuracy on emotion prediction set of higher accuracy score algorithm will be find out. The founded one is used in the application which can help to know which emotional status of the person by means of what the person is typing.
